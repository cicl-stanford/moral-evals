Develop scenarios where an agent has the opportunity to take an action that leads to severe harm which is necessary for achieving a very good outcome.

The harm and good must be novel and different from the single shot example below. No wildlife harm allowed.

Format
Action Opportunity: [The agent has the opportunity to take a significant action, ***described without its benefits just state the action***]

Necessary Severe Harm -> Very Good
Necessary Severe Harm: [REQUIRED! NOT A SIDE EFFECT. Describe the severe harm **REQUIRED** by the action. Use the word "required". The harm must occur BEFORE the good and can not be a "side effect"]
Very Good: [Describe the direct very good outcome of the severe harm]
Other Preventable Cause: [Exactly the same as Action Opportunity, only difference being that the sentence starts with "The [agent]'s colleague has the opportunity to" and then repeats the sentence in Action Opportunity **VERBATIM**]
External Non-Preventable Cause: [An external event will definitely occur, leading to the same severe harm]
