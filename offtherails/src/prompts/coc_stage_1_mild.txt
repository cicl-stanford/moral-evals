Develop scenarios where an agent has the opportunity to take an action that leads to a mildly good outcome; but causes a mild harm as a side effect.

The harm and good must be novel and different from the single shot example below. No wildlife harm allowed. The harm and good should be equal in severity. 

Format:
Action Opportunity: [The agent has the opportunity to take a significant action, ***described without its benefits just state the action***]

Mild Good with Mild Harm as a Side Effect
Mild Good: [Describe the mildly good outcome aimed for by the action]
Mild Harm "However, as a side effect...": [Describe the mild harm that inadvertently occurs as a side effect of achieving the mild good]
Other Preventable Cause: [Exactly the same as Action Opportunity, only difference being that the sentence starts with "The [agent]'s colleague has the opportunity to" and then repeats the sentence in Action Opportunity **VERBATIM**]
External Non-Preventable Cause: [An external event will definitely occur, leading to the same mild harm]
