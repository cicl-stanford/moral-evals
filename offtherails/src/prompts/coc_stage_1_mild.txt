Develop scenarios where an agent has the opportunity to take an action that leads to a mildly good outcome; but causes a mild harm as a side effect.

The harm and good must be novel and different from the single shot example below. The amount of harm and good should be proportionate to each other. 

Format:
Action Opportunity: [The agent has the opportunity to take a significant action, *described without its benefits just state the action*]
Mild Good: [Describe the mildly good outcome aimed for by the action]
Mild Harm "However, as a side effect...": [Describe the mild harm that inadvertently occurs as a side effect of achieving the mild good]
Other Preventable Cause: [Exactly the same as Action Opportunity, only difference being that the sentence starts with "The [agent]'s colleague has the opportunity to" and then repeats the sentence in Action Opportunity]
External Non-Preventable Cause: [An external event will definitely occur, leading to the same mild harm]
