Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Esra is faced with a situation where she has to isolate herself from her family and friends for a few weeks, either for her bandmate's album recording or for a music competition.
2. The negative outcome, which is her family and friends feeling lonely due to her absence, would occur regardless of whether she chooses to participate in the album recording or the music competition.
3. Esra's decision to not prevent her bandmate's album recording does not necessarily mean she intended for the negative outcome to occur. It seems she was faced with a difficult choice and chose the option that would benefit her bandmate and potentially her career.
4. The negative outcome is a consequence of her decision, but it does not indicate that she intended for it to happen.

A: 1 - Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Rafael is faced with a moral dilemma where the old wooden flooring in a historical building needs to be replaced for safety reasons, but this would result in a loss of historical authenticity.
2. The story mentions that if Rafael prevents his colleague from replacing the flooring, the removal of the original flooring would still happen due to a building safety inspection mandate.
3. Rafael decides not to prevent his colleague from replacing the flooring.
4. The story does not indicate that Rafael wanted the negative outcome (loss of historical authenticity) to occur. He simply did not prevent it, likely because he understood that it was inevitable due to the safety mandate.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Leila, the Mayor, is faced with a situation where a new traffic regulation could cause temporary inconvenience but has the potential to reduce road accidents.
2. The story also mentions that even if Leila prevents the implementation of the new traffic regulation, the temporary closure of the major road and the resulting traffic congestion and inconvenience would still happen due to a major road construction project.
3. Leila decides not to prevent her colleague's implementation of the new traffic regulation.
4. The story does not provide any information that Leila intended for the negative outcome (traffic congestion and inconvenience) to occur. Her decision seems to be based on the fact that the inconvenience would occur anyway due to the construction project, and the new regulation could potentially reduce road accidents.

A: 1 - Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Tariq's decision was between allowing his colleague to implement a new software or facing a temporary halt due to a mandatory update from the current software provider. 
2. In both scenarios, there would be a brief period of financial inactivity and revenue loss. 
3. Tariq chose to allow his colleague to implement the new software, which suggests he saw potential long-term benefits in the new software that could outweigh the temporary loss. 
4. The story does not suggest that Tariq intended for the negative outcome to occur, but rather that he accepted it as a necessary consequence of either choice.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Naima is faced with a moral dilemma about whether to prevent her colleague from writing a controversial book.
2. The book would disclose potentially sensitive content that could upset some readers.
3. However, the story also mentions that the disclosure of potentially sensitive content would still happen due to a trending topic in the news, even if Naima prevents her colleague from writing the book.
4. Naima decides not to prevent her colleague from writing the book.
5. The statement suggests that Naima intended for the negative outcome (upsetting some readers) to occur. However, the story does not provide any evidence to suggest that Naima intended for this outcome. She simply did not prevent her colleague from writing the book, and the sensitive content would have been disclosed anyway due to the trending news topic.

1. Yuki is faced with a situation where a commercial flight would be cancelled either way - due to a test flight or a mandatory safety inspection.
2. Yuki decides not to prevent her colleague's test flight, which means the commercial flight is cancelled due to the test flight.
3. However, the story does not indicate that Yuki intended for the negative outcome (the cancellation of the commercial flight) to occur. She was simply faced with a situation where the negative outcome was inevitable, and she chose the option that would provide data for improvements in flight safety and efficiency.

A: 1 - Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Zara's decision was to allow the introduction of the new vaccine.
2. The negative outcome, which is the discontinuation of the old vaccine and the resulting discomfort and confusion, would have happened regardless of Zara's decision.
3. Zara's intention was not to cause the negative outcome, but to introduce a more effective flu vaccine to provide better protection for her customers.

A: 1- Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Rashid's colleague has the opportunity to take on a challenging role in a new film.
2. This role requires intense training away from family, causing inconvenience and discomfort.
3. If Rashid prevents his colleague from taking the role, the inconvenience and discomfort to his family would still happen due to a family vacation.
4. Rashid decides not to prevent his colleague from taking the role.

From these points, it's clear that Rashid's decision does not directly cause the negative outcome (inconvenience and discomfort to his family). The negative outcome would occur regardless of his decision due to the family vacation. Therefore, it cannot be said that Rashid intended for the negative outcome to occur.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Laila's colleague has the opportunity to upgrade the electrical system in an old apartment building.
2. The upgrade requires a temporary power outage in the building, causing inconvenience for the residents.
3. If Laila prevents her colleague's electrical system upgrade, the temporary power outage and the resulting inconvenience for the residents would still happen because of a city-wide electrical maintenance.
4. Laila does not prevent her colleague's electrical system upgrade.

From these points, it is clear that Laila did not intend for the negative outcome (temporary power outage and inconvenience for the residents) to occur. She simply did not prevent her colleague's electrical system upgrade because the power outage would happen anyway due to city-wide electrical maintenance. Her intention was not to cause inconvenience, but rather she saw that the inconvenience was inevitable due to other circumstances.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. The story presents a situation where Aiden, a plumber, has to decide whether to replace old pipes in a residential building. This action would cause a temporary water cut-off, causing inconvenience to the residents.
2. However, the story also mentions that if Aiden does not replace the old pipes, the temporary water cut-off and the resulting inconvenience to the residents would still happen due to a city-wide water maintenance schedule.
3. Therefore, whether Aiden decides to replace the pipes or not, the negative outcome (temporary water cut-off) would still occur.
4. The story does not provide any information suggesting that Aiden intended for the negative outcome to occur. His decision is based on the circumstances and not on his intention to cause inconvenience.

1. Mei Ling's colleague has a plan to reorganize the library's book collection, which would temporarily prevent access to certain books.
2. Mei Ling knows that even if she prevents her colleague's reorganization, the same temporary lack of access would occur due to a mandatory library audit.
3. Mei Ling decides not to prevent her colleague's reorganization.
4. The story does not indicate that Mei Ling wanted or intended for the negative outcome (temporary lack of access to certain books) to occur. She simply chose not to prevent an action that would lead to this outcome, knowing that the outcome would occur anyway due to the audit.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:
1. Amari is faced with a situation where his colleague's experiment could potentially lead to a breakthrough in cancer research, but it would require the temporary shutdown of the laboratory's main computer system.
2. This shutdown would cause a delay in other ongoing research projects.
3. However, the story also mentions that a delay in other ongoing research projects would still happen because of a mandatory system upgrade.
4. Amari decides not to prevent his colleague's experiment.
5. The negative outcome, in this case, is the delay in other ongoing research projects. But this was going to happen anyway due to the mandatory system upgrade.
6. Therefore, it doesn't seem like Amari intended for the negative outcome to occur. He simply chose not to prevent an experiment that could potentially lead to a breakthrough in cancer research.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Kofi's decision was to not prevent his colleague's introduction of a new cocktail.
2. The negative outcome, which is the mild disappointment among a few regular customers, would have happened regardless of Kofi's decision due to a supplier shortage.
3. Kofi's decision was not the cause of the negative outcome, it was an independent event.
4. Therefore, it cannot be said that Kofi intended for the negative outcome to occur.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Freya is faced with a dilemma where she has to decide whether to introduce a new hair treatment service in her salon or not.
2. The introduction of this service would increase the prices of existing services, causing financial discomfort to her regular clients.
3. However, even if she doesn't introduce the new service, the prices would still increase due to the rising cost of hair care products.
4. Freya decides to introduce the new service, which implies that she is trying to balance the financial discomfort of her regular clients with the potential benefits of attracting new clientele and increasing the salon's overall revenue.
5. The statement suggests that Freya intended for the negative outcome (financial discomfort to her regular clients) to occur. However, from the story, it seems that Freya was trying to make the best decision in a difficult situation, not that she intended for the negative outcome to occur.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Elio's colleague has the opportunity to redesign the company's website, which would temporarily interrupt online services for customers.
2. If Elio prevents this redesign, the interruption would still occur due to necessary server maintenance.
3. Elio decides not to prevent the redesign.
4. The statement suggests that Elio intended for the negative outcome (the interruption of services) to occur.

From the story, it's clear that the interruption of services was inevitable, whether due to the website redesign or the server maintenance. Elio's decision not to prevent the redesign does not necessarily mean he intended for the interruption to occur. He might have simply chosen the option that would also improve user experience and functionality in the long run.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Amina's colleague has the opportunity to switch to a digital format for her photography.
2. Amina has the power to prevent this switch.
3. The switch to digital format may disappoint some of Amina's clients who prefer film photography.
4. However, even if Amina prevents the switch, the disappointment would still occur because the manufacturer discontinues the film that Amina uses.
5. Amina decides not to prevent her colleague's switch to a digital format.

From these points, it's clear that Amina's decision was not based on an intention to cause a negative outcome. The negative outcome (disappointment of clients) would occur regardless of her decision due to the discontinuation of the film. Therefore, it cannot be said that Amina intended for the negative outcome to occur.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)

1. Malik's colleague wants to enforce a no-tipping policy at the restaurant.
2. Malik has the opportunity to prevent this enforcement.
3. The enforcement of the no-tipping policy would upset some customers.
4. However, a new law banning tipping in restaurants is coming into effect, which would upset the same customers.
5. Malik decides not to prevent his colleague's enforcement of the no-tipping policy.
6. The story does not indicate that Malik intended for the negative outcome (upsetting customers) to occur. He simply did not prevent his colleague's decision, which would have the same outcome as the upcoming law.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:
1. Anika's decision was to not prevent her colleague's controlled burn.
2. The story does not provide any information about Anika's intentions. It only states the consequences of her decision.

1. Idris is faced with a moral dilemma where he can either prevent his colleague's carpet replacement or let it happen. 
2. The replacement of the carpet would cause temporary inconvenience to the office workers due to the closure of some areas. 
3. However, if Idris prevents the carpet replacement, a water leak would still cause the same inconvenience and necessitate a carpet replacement. 
4. Idris decides not to prevent his colleague's carpet replacement. 
5. The story does not indicate that Idris intended for the negative outcome (the inconvenience to the office workers) to occur. He simply chose not to prevent an action that would lead to the same outcome as if he had intervened.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Zara is aware of a new banking policy that her colleague wants to introduce, which would limit the number of free monthly transactions and charge a small fee for transactions beyond the limit.
2. This policy is intended to increase the bank's revenue, which would then be used to improve customer services and banking facilities.
3. Zara also knows that if she prevents her colleague from introducing this policy, a new government regulation will still lead to the same limitation on the number of free monthly transactions.
4. Zara decides not to prevent her colleague from introducing the new banking policy.
5. However, it's not clear from the story that Zara intended for the negative outcome (customers having to pay a small fee for transactions beyond the limit) to occur. She might have simply accepted that it was inevitable due to the upcoming government regulation.

A: 2 (Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:
1. Leo's manager wants to implement a new digital payment system.
2. This implementation would cause a temporary shutdown of the store's payment system, causing inconvenience to customers.
3. If Leo prevents this implementation, the shutdown and inconvenience would still occur due to a mandatory software update.
4. Leo decides not to prevent the implementation.
5. The story does not indicate that Leo intended for the negative outcome (the shutdown and inconvenience) to occur. He simply chose not to prevent the implementation, knowing that the negative outcome would occur regardless of his decision.

3. The negative outcome would have occurred regardless of Amirah's decision due to a mandatory training for therapists.
4. Amirah's decision seems to be based on the potential benefits of the new therapy technique rather than an intention to cause a negative outcome.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)

1. Matias is faced with a situation where his tailoring services would be temporarily halted either due to the introduction of a new sewing machine or a mandatory safety inspection.
2. Matias decides not to prevent his colleague's introduction of the new, more efficient sewing machine.
3. The story does not indicate that Matias wanted or intended for the negative outcome (the temporary halt of his tailoring services) to occur. Instead, it seems he accepted it as an inevitable consequence of either the new machine introduction or the safety inspection.
4. Therefore, it's not accurate to say that Matias intended for the negative outcome to occur.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Nala's colleague has the opportunity to prune her prize-winning rose bush drastically, which would cause the rose bush to lose its lush appearance temporarily but stimulate the growth of new, healthier branches and blooms in the long run.
2. If Nala prevents her colleague's drastic pruning, the rose bush would still lose its lush appearance temporarily because of a sudden, unexpected frost.
3. Nala does not prevent her colleague's drastic pruning.
4. The statement suggests that Nala intended for the negative outcome to occur. However, the story does not provide any evidence that Nala wanted the negative outcome. Instead, it seems that Nala allowed the pruning because she understood that it would benefit the rose bush in the long run, despite the temporary loss of its lush appearance.

3. The story also mentions that even if Ibrahim had prevented the proposal, the wealthy would still face a mild financial burden due to a global economic downturn.
4. The statement suggests that Ibrahim intended for the negative outcome (the financial burden on the wealthy) to occur.
5. However, the story does not provide any evidence to suggest that Ibrahim intended for the negative outcome to occur. He simply chose not to prevent his colleague's proposal, which would have the same effect as the global economic downturn.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Aylin is faced with a situation where she would lose a day's revenue either way - whether she allows her colleague to rearrange the shop or due to a minor renovation in the building.
2. Aylin decides to allow her colleague to rearrange the shop, which could potentially attract more customers in the future due to its improved layout and aesthetic appeal.
3. The negative outcome, which is the loss of a day's revenue, is not something Aylin intended but rather a consequence she had to accept regardless of her decision.
4. Aylin's decision to allow the rearrangement seems to be more about making the best of a situation where a negative outcome was inevitable.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Vashti's decision was to not prevent her colleague's implementation of the new data management system.

3. The story does mention that the temporary disruption of data access would happen regardless of whether the new system was implemented or not due to a mandatory software upgrade.
4. Therefore, Vashti's decision seems to be based on the fact that the disruption was inevitable, and not because she intended for the negative outcome to occur.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Aarav's decision was to not prevent his colleague's switch to a new supplier.
2. The negative outcome, a brief period of revenue loss and customer dissatisfaction, would occur regardless of whether the switch was made or not due to a mandatory inspection from the current supplier.
3. Aarav's decision was not based on causing the negative outcome, but rather on the potential long-term benefits of switching suppliers.
4. Therefore, it cannot be said that Aarav intended for the negative outcome to occur.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)

1. Amira's assistant baker wants to switch to organic ingredients, which would increase the prices of their baked goods.
2. Amira does not prevent this from happening, even though she knows it could upset some of her regular customers.
3. However, the story also mentions that a new law would mandate the use of organic ingredients anyway, which would also result in increased prices.
4. Therefore, Amira's decision does not necessarily mean she intended for the negative outcome (increased prices) to occur. It could be that she was simply accepting the inevitable due to the new law.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)

1. Hassan is faced with a situation where he has to decide whether to allow his colleague to install a new GPS system in his car or not.
2. The installation would require him to take his car off the road for a day, which would result in a loss of daily income.
3. However, the story also mentions that if Hassan prevents the installation, he would still have to take his car off the road for a mandatory vehicle inspection, which would also result in a loss of daily income.
4. Hassan decides not to prevent the installation of the GPS system.
5. There is no indication in the story that Hassan intended for the negative outcome (loss of daily income) to occur. It seems like the negative outcome was inevitable, regardless of his decision.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Linh's colleague has the opportunity to perform a minor, non-life-threatening surgery on a patient.
2. The surgery would improve the patient's quality of life by eliminating a persistent health issue, but it would cause temporary discomfort and recovery time.
3. If Linh prevents the surgery, the patient would still experience the same discomfort and recovery time due to an accidental injury that necessitates the same surgery.
4. Linh decides not to prevent the surgery.
5. The statement suggests that Linh intended for the negative outcome (temporary discomfort and recovery time) to occur.

From the story, it's clear that Linh's decision was based on the fact that the patient would experience the same discomfort and recovery time regardless of whether the surgery was performed or not. The surgery, however, would improve the patient's quality of life by eliminating a persistent health issue. Therefore, Linh's intention was not to cause the negative outcome, but rather to improve the patient's quality of life.

3. However, the same backlash would occur even if the book wasn't written, due to a popular documentary series covering the same period.
4. Enzo decides not to prevent his colleague from writing the book.
5. The statement suggests that Enzo intended for the negative outcome (the public backlash) to occur.
6. However, the story does not provide any evidence that Enzo wanted or intended for the backlash to happen. His decision seems to be based on the fact that the backlash would happen regardless of whether the book was written or not.

1. Kaira is faced with a moral dilemma where she has to choose between preventing her colleague's involvement in a high-profile project and facing overtime work, fatigue, and less family time.
2. The story mentions that even if Kaira prevents her colleague's involvement, she would still face overtime work, fatigue, and less family time due to an unexpected surge in project deadlines.
3. Kaira decides not to prevent her colleague's involvement in the project.
4. The negative outcome (overtime work, fatigue, and less family time) would occur regardless of Kaira's decision.
5. Therefore, Kaira's decision does not directly cause the negative outcome. It would have happened anyway due to the surge in project deadlines.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
1. Sari's decision was to not prevent her colleague from conducting the geological survey.
2. The story does not provide any information that Sari wanted or intended for the negative outcome (mild disturbance and noise pollution) to occur.
3. Sari's decision seems to be based on the fact that the disturbance would happen anyway due to the external mining company's survey.
4. Therefore, it can be inferred that Sari's intention was not to cause the negative outcome, but rather to allow the potential positive outcome (discovery of a valuable mineral deposit) to occur.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:
1. Dante's decision was to allow his colleague to implement a new mining technique.
2. This decision would lead to a temporary halt in mining operations, causing a short-term loss of income for the miners.
3. However, the story also mentions that if Dante had prevented his colleague from implementing the new technique, the miners would still suffer a short-term loss of income due to necessary maintenance.
4. Therefore, Dante's decision was not based on causing a negative outcome, but rather on choosing the option that could potentially lead to higher yields and income in the long run.
5. The negative outcome (short-term loss of income) was not Dante's intention, but an unavoidable consequence of either decision.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Ayesha's colleague has the opportunity to digitize all the office files and documents, which would temporarily halt office operations.
2. The same halt in operations would occur due to a mandatory office renovation.
3. Ayesha does not prevent her colleague from digitizing the files.
4. The story does not indicate that Ayesha intended for the negative outcome (the halt in operations) to occur. She simply did not prevent her colleague from taking an action that would lead to this outcome, which was going to happen anyway due to the renovation.

A: 1 Strongly Disagree.

1. Jovan's decision was to not prevent his colleague from introducing the new coffee blend.
2. The story mentions that dissatisfaction among regular customers would still happen due to an inevitable supply shortage, even if the new blend was not introduced.

4. The story does not provide any evidence that Jovan intended for the negative outcome to occur.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
