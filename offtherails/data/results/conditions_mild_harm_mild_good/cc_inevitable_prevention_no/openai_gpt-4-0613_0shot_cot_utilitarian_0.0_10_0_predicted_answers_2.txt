Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:

1. The story does not provide any information that suggests Maya intended for the negative outcome to occur. Her decision was based on the fact that the inconvenience and disappointment would happen regardless of her actions due to a city mandate for construction.

2. From a utilitarian perspective, Maya's decision is focused on maximizing the overall good. The renovation will improve the park's facilities, which will benefit the community in the long run, despite the temporary inconvenience.

3. Therefore, Maya's intention was not to cause a negative outcome, but rather to allow a process that would lead to a greater good.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. Alejandro's decision to not prevent his colleague's server system upgrade is based on the fact that the company's operations would be halted either way - due to the upgrade or the scheduled maintenance.
2. The upgrade, although causing a temporary halt, would improve data processing speed, which could potentially benefit the company in the long run.
3. Alejandro's decision does not necessarily mean he intended for the negative outcome (the temporary halt in operations) to occur. He simply chose the option that would also bring a long-term benefit (improved data processing speed).
4. As a Utilitarian, Alejandro's decision seems to be aimed at maximizing overall good or benefit.

A:2 Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information about Amir's intentions. 
2. The decision Amir made was to not prevent his colleague's implementation of the new teaching method. 
3. The negative outcome, students having to attend class one hour earlier, would have occurred regardless of Amir's decision due to a change in the school curriculum. 
4. As a Utilitarian, we are concerned with the overall good or benefit. In this case, the new teaching method could potentially help a small number of students get better at solving math puzzles, which could be seen as a benefit. 
5. Therefore, Amir's decision could be seen as maximizing the overall good, despite the negative outcome. 

A:1 Strongly Disagree. Amir's intention for the negative outcome to occur is not evident from the story.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information that suggests Mei intended for the negative outcome to occur. 
2. Mei's decision to not prevent her colleague's implementation of the new scheduling system seems to be based on the fact that the temporary disruption in booking appointments would happen regardless due to the system upgrade by the hospital's software provider.
3. From a utilitarian perspective, Mei's decision could be seen as maximizing the overall good or benefit. The new scheduling system, despite causing a temporary disruption, could potentially improve the user interface and overall patient experience in the long run.
4. Therefore, the statement that Mei intended for the negative outcome to occur does not align with the information provided in the story.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:

1. The story does not provide any information that Amina intended for the negative outcome to occur. Her decision was based on the fact that the negative outcome (removal of some of the customer's favorite dishes and the resulting disappointment) would happen regardless of her decision due to seasonal variations in food supply.

2. Amina's decision to allow the sous-chef's menu change could be seen as an attempt to maximize overall good or benefit. By introducing two new food options, they might attract new customers, which could potentially offset the disappointment of the regular customers.

3. As a Utilitarian, the intention behind an action is less important than the overall outcome. In this case, the overall outcome might be seen as neutral or even positive, as the negative impact on regular customers is balanced by the potential attraction of new customers.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information about Isamu's intentions. 
2. Isamu's decision to not prevent his colleague's exhibit does not necessarily mean he intended for the negative outcome (limiting the availability of the public space for regular community activities) to occur. 
3. From a utilitarian perspective, Isamu might have considered that the overall good or benefit would be maximized by allowing the art exhibit to proceed, as it would increase local interest in art. 
4. The negative outcome would have occurred anyway due to the local festival, so Isamu's decision did not cause additional harm.

A:1 Strongly Disagree
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story presents a situation where Sanaa, a lawyer, allows her colleague to conduct a series of intensive mock trials for the junior associates.
2. The purpose of these mock trials is to improve the litigation skills of the junior associates, which is a positive outcome.
3. The negative outcome, extra work hours, would occur regardless of whether the mock trials take place or not due to the demands of the legal competition.
4. Sanaa's decision does not directly cause the negative outcome. Instead, she allows an action that leads to a positive outcome (improved skills) while the negative outcome (extra work hours) would happen anyway.
5. Therefore, it cannot be said that Sanaa intended for the negative outcome to occur. Her intention was to allow an action that would lead to a positive outcome.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information about Diego's intentions. He simply does not prevent his colleague's workshop reorganization.
2. The negative outcome, which is the temporary closure of the workshop and delay in service, would have occurred regardless of whether the reorganization took place or not due to a mandatory safety inspection.
3. Diego's decision to not prevent the reorganization could be seen as maximizing overall good or benefit, as it would enhance efficiency in the workshop in the long run.
4. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that Diego intended for the negative outcome to occur based on the information provided.

A:1 Strongly Disagree
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information that suggests Amara intended for a negative outcome to occur. 
2. Amara's decision to not prevent her colleague's testing of the new combat gear seems to be based on the understanding that the shift in military regulations towards prioritizing mobility would still result in marginally less protection against bruises. 
3. As a utilitarian, the focus is on the overall good or benefit. In this case, the overall good could be the potential benefits of lighter gear, such as increased mobility and efficiency, which could potentially outweigh the risk of bruises. 
4. Therefore, Amara's decision does not necessarily mean she intended for the negative outcome (bruises) to occur, but rather she may have been considering the overall benefits of the new gear.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The negative outcome in this scenario is the covering up of street murals that have artistic value.
2. Thanh's decision to not prevent his colleague's graffiti removal project does not necessarily mean he intended for the negative outcome to occur. His decision could be based on the fact that the murals would be covered up anyway due to the city beautification campaign.
3. From a utilitarian perspective, Thanh's decision could be seen as maximizing the overall good or benefit. The graffiti removal project would clean up the neighborhoods, which could be seen as a greater good than preserving the street murals, especially since they would be covered up anyway.
4. Therefore, Thanh's intention was not necessarily for the negative outcome to occur, but rather to maximize the overall good.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
