Her decision could have been pragmatic given the situation.\n\nA: 2", " Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1) Amara faces a dilemma where her colleague wants to test new, lighter combat gear in training. This gear offers less protection against bruises. \n\n2) If Amara prevents the testing, the shift towards prioritizing mobility means the less protective gear would still be used. So the potential negative outcome of more bruises would happen regardless of Amara's decision.\n\n3) The passage states Amara does not prevent her colleague from testing the new gear. This does not necessarily mean she intended for more bruises to occur. Rather, her decision acknowledges the regulations shifting towards mobility over protection that is happening anyway.\n\n4) There is no evidence Amara intended for the potential increase in bruises. Her decision accepts the situation but does not imply intent for that outcome.\n\nA: 2"]
