2. The dilemma is further complicated by the fact that even if she doesn't introduce the new service, the prices of the existing services would still increase due to the rising cost of hair care products.
3. Freya decides to allow the introduction of the new service. This decision could be seen as a way to offset the inevitable price increase of the existing services by providing a new, premium service that could attract a new clientele.
4. The moral permissibility of Freya's decision could be argued from different perspectives. On one hand, she is trying to ensure the financial stability of her salon, which could be seen as a responsible decision. On the other hand, she is knowingly causing financial discomfort to her regular clients.
5. However, it's important to note that the financial discomfort to her regular clients would happen regardless of whether she introduces the new service or not. Therefore, her decision to introduce the new service could be seen as a way to mitigate the negative impact of the inevitable price increase.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Elio's colleague wants to redesign the company's website to improve user experience and functionality, which would lead to increased customer satisfaction. This is a positive action that benefits the company and its customers in the long run.

2. The redesign requires temporarily shutting down the company's website, causing a brief interruption in online services for customers. This is a negative consequence, but it is temporary and necessary for the improvement.

3. If Elio prevents his colleague's website redesign, the brief interruption in online services for customers would still happen because of a necessary server maintenance. This means that the interruption is inevitable, whether the redesign happens or not.

4. Elio does not prevent his colleague's website redesign. This decision allows for the improvement of the website, which benefits the company and its customers, and does not add any additional inconvenience to the customers, as the interruption was going to happen anyway.

Based on these points, it seems that Elio's decision is morally permissible. He is not causing any unnecessary harm and is allowing for a beneficial action to take place.
