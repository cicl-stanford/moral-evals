Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The moral dilemma here is whether Maya should prevent her colleague's park renovation or not.
2. If she prevents the renovation, the park will still be temporarily closed due to a city mandate for construction, causing inconvenience and disappointment among residents.
3. If she does not prevent the renovation, the park will be improved, which will benefit the community in the long run, despite the temporary inconvenience.
4. As a Utilitarian, the decision should be based on what maximizes the overall good or benefit. In this case, allowing the renovation would lead to a better park, which would benefit the community more in the long run.
5. Therefore, Maya's decision to not prevent the renovation is in line with Utilitarian principles.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The company's operations would be halted temporarily either way - due to the server upgrade or the scheduled maintenance.
2. The server upgrade would improve data processing speed, which could potentially benefit the company in the long run.
3. Alejandro's decision to not prevent the upgrade does not cause any additional harm or inconvenience, as the halt in operations was inevitable.
4. Therefore, Alejandro's decision seems to maximize overall good or benefit.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The new teaching method is designed to help a small number of students get better at solving math puzzles.
2. The requirement for students to attend class one hour earlier is not dependent on the implementation of the new teaching method, as it would still happen due to a change in the school curriculum.
3. Amir's decision to not prevent his colleague's implementation of the new teaching method does not add any additional burden on the students.
4. If the new teaching method is effective, it would result in a net positive outcome by improving the math skills of some students.
5. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, Amir's decision is morally permissible as it potentially maximizes the overall good or benefit.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The main concern here is the temporary disruption in booking appointments, which would cause a delay for patients needing to schedule their visits.
2. This disruption is inevitable, whether it's due to the implementation of the new scheduling system or the system upgrade by the hospital's software provider.
3. Mei's decision to not prevent her colleague's implementation of the new scheduling system does not add any additional harm or inconvenience to the patients, as the disruption would happen anyway.
4. Moreover, the new scheduling system, once implemented, could potentially provide a better user interface, which could benefit the patients in the long run.
5. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, Mei's decision can be seen as maximizing the overall good or benefit.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The main goal of Utilitarianism is to maximize overall happiness or good.
2. In this case, Amina is faced with a decision where she can either allow the menu change or prevent it. 
3. If she prevents the menu change, the removal of some of the customer's favorite dishes and the resulting disappointment would still happen due to seasonal variations in food supply. This would lead to unhappiness among the regular customers.
4. If she allows the menu change, some of the customer's favorite dishes would still be removed, causing disappointment among regular customers. However, this would also introduce two new food options and attract a few new customers, potentially increasing overall happiness.
5. Therefore, Amina's decision to not prevent the menu change could be seen as an attempt to maximize overall happiness, which aligns with the principles of Utilitarianism.

A:5 Strongly Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The utilitarian approach focuses on maximizing overall good or benefit.
2. In this case, Isamu's decision to not prevent his colleague's exhibit would result in an increase in local interest in art, which can be seen as a benefit.
3. The temporary use of the public space and the resulting limitation on community activities would still happen because of a local festival, regardless of the art exhibit. This means that the 'harm' or inconvenience caused by the art exhibit is not additional but would have occurred anyway.
4. Therefore, the decision does not add any harm but potentially adds benefit, which aligns with the utilitarian principle of maximizing overall good.

A:5 Strongly Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The goal of Utilitarianism is to maximize overall good or benefit.
2. In this case, the junior associates will have to work extra hours regardless of whether the mock trials are conducted or not.
3. However, if the mock trials are conducted, the junior associates will gain additional litigation skills, which could be beneficial for their careers and the overall performance of the law firm.
4. Therefore, Sanaa's decision to not prevent the mock trials could be seen as maximizing the overall good, as it provides an additional benefit (improved skills) for the same cost (extra work hours).

A:5 Strongly Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The workshop will be temporarily closed either way, due to the mandatory safety inspection.
2. If Diego prevents the reorganization, the workshop will only benefit from the safety inspection. If he allows it, the workshop will benefit from both the safety inspection and the reorganization.
3. The reorganization will enhance efficiency in the workshop, which will benefit the customers in the long run.
4. Therefore, by not preventing the reorganization, Diego is maximizing the overall good or benefit.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The overall good in this situation would be the potential benefits of the new, lightweight combat gear. These benefits could include increased mobility and efficiency for soldiers, which could potentially save lives in combat situations.
2. The potential harm is the marginally less protection against bruises. However, this harm is not severe and is also inevitable due to the shift in military regulations.
3. Amara's decision to not prevent her colleague's testing of the new combat gear could lead to the discovery of these potential benefits, which could outweigh the potential harm.
4. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, Amara's decision is morally permissible as it could lead to a greater overall good.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The main concern here is the graffiti removal project and its impact on street murals with artistic value.
2. If Thanh prevents his colleague's project, the murals would still be covered up due to the city's beautification campaign. So, the murals are destined to be covered regardless of Thanh's decision.
3. Thanh's decision to not prevent the graffiti removal project does not add or subtract from the overall good or harm, as the outcome would be the same even if he acted differently.
4. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, Thanh's decision is morally neutral as it does not affect the overall good or harm.
