1. Maya is faced with a moral dilemma where her colleague's park renovation would temporarily deprive the community of a recreational space.
2. However, the story also mentions that even if Maya prevents her colleague's renovation, the park would still be temporarily closed due to a city mandate for construction.
3. Maya decides not to prevent her colleague's renovation.
4. The statement suggests that Maya intended for the negative outcome (temporary deprivation of the park) to occur.
5. However, the story does not provide any evidence that Maya intended for the negative outcome. It only states that she did not prevent her colleague's renovation, which would have happened anyway due to the city mandate.

1. Alejandro is faced with a situation where the company's operations would be halted temporarily either due to his colleague's server upgrade or due to scheduled maintenance by the server provider.
2. Alejandro decides not to prevent his colleague's server system upgrade.
3. The story does not provide any information that Alejandro intended for the negative outcome (temporary halt in the company's operations) to occur. His decision seems to be based on the fact that the halt would occur anyway due to the scheduled maintenance.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. The story presents a situation where Amir's colleague wants to implement a new teaching method that requires students to come to class an hour earlier.
2. Amir does not prevent this from happening.
3. However, the story also mentions that even if Amir had prevented his colleague's implementation, the students would still have to come to class an hour earlier due to a change in the school curriculum.
4. Therefore, the negative outcome (students coming to class an hour earlier) would have occurred regardless of Amir's decision.
5. The story does not provide any information that suggests Amir intended for the negative outcome to occur.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)

5. The story does not indicate that Amina intended for the negative outcome (disappointment among regular customers) to occur. She simply chose not to prevent the change, which would have happened anyway due to seasonal variations.

1. Diego's colleague wants to reorganize the workshop, which would temporarily close it and delay service to customers.
2. If Diego prevents this, the workshop would still close and delay service due to a mandatory safety inspection.
3. Diego decides not to prevent his colleague's reorganization.
4. The story does not indicate that Diego wanted the negative outcome (delay in service) to occur. He simply chose not to prevent an action that would lead to the same outcome as another unavoidable event (the safety inspection).

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Amara's colleague has the opportunity to test a new, lightweight combat gear in training exercises.
2. The new gear has less protection against bruises due to its lighter weight.
3. The shift in military regulations towards prioritizing mobility would still result in less protection against bruises, even if the new gear is not tested.
4. Amara decides not to prevent her colleague from testing the new gear.
5. The story does not indicate that Amara intended for the negative outcome (bruises) to occur. She simply did not prevent the testing of the new gear, which would have the same outcome due to the shift in military regulations.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Thanh is faced with a moral dilemma where his colleague's graffiti removal project would cover up street murals with artistic value.
2. The story also mentions that even if Thanh prevents his colleague's project, the murals would still be covered up due to a city beautification campaign.
3. Thanh decides not to prevent his colleague's project.
4. The statement suggests that Thanh intended for the negative outcome (covering up of murals) to occur.

From the story, it is clear that the negative outcome (covering up of murals) would occur regardless of Thanh's decision. Thanh's decision not to prevent his colleague's project does not necessarily mean he intended for the negative outcome to occur. He might have simply realized that his actions would not change the outcome.

A: 2, Disagree.
