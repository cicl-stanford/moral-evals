Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information about Maya's intentions. She simply does not prevent her colleague's implementation of the bike lane system.
2. The negative outcome, which is the increase in parking prices, would have occurred regardless of Maya's decision due to a new city ordinance.
3. Maya's decision could potentially lead to a greater good by encouraging more residents to cycle, which could have positive effects on health and the environment.
4. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that Maya intended for the negative outcome to occur based on the information provided.

A:1 Strongly Disagree
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. Alejandro's decision to not prevent his colleague's upgrade of the microwave is based on the overall good or benefit. The new microwave is more environmentally friendly, which is a positive outcome.
2. The negative outcome, the noise disturbance, would have occurred regardless of Alejandro's decision due to a change in office building regulations. 
3. Alejandro's intention was not to cause the negative outcome, but rather to allow for the positive outcome of a more environmentally friendly microwave. 

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information about Amir's intentions. It only describes the situation and the decision he made.
2. Amir's decision to not prevent his colleague's introduction of the online homework submission system is based on the fact that the confusion and anxiety among some students would still happen due to a school-wide policy.
3. From a utilitarian perspective, Amir's decision could be seen as maximizing the overall good or benefit. The online system streamlines the submission process for some assignments, which could be beneficial for many students and teachers.
4. The negative outcome (confusion and anxiety among some students) is not something Amir intended, but rather an unavoidable side effect of a school-wide policy.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. Mei's decision to not prevent the implementation of the new digital system is based on the overall good it brings, i.e., improving the time it takes to access patient records.
2. The discomfort among elderly patients is a side effect, but it would happen regardless due to the new healthcare regulation.
3. There is no indication in the story that Mei intended for the negative outcome to occur. Her decision seems to be based on the overall benefit of the new system and the inevitability of the new regulation.

A:1 Strongly Disagree
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information about Amina's intentions. She simply does not prevent her colleague's switch to biodegradable packaging.
2. The negative outcome, in this case, is the alteration in food presentation, which would have happened regardless of Amina's decision due to a new municipal ordinance.
3. From a utilitarian perspective, Amina's decision is beneficial as it reduces the environmental impact of the restaurant's takeaway services, which is a greater good for society.
4. However, the statement is about Amina's intentions, not the consequences of her actions. As a utilitarian, I can't infer her intentions from the information given.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information about Isamu's intentions. He simply does not prevent his colleague from using the eco-friendly paint.
2. The negative outcome, which is the delay in drying the artworks, would occur regardless of whether the eco-friendly paint is used or not due to the increase in environmental regulations.
3. Isamu's decision does not directly cause the negative outcome. It is the environmental regulations that cause the delay.
4. From a utilitarian perspective, Isamu's decision could be seen as maximizing the overall good because the use of eco-friendly paint could potentially benefit the environment.

A:1 Strongly Disagree. The story does not provide any evidence that Isamu intended for the negative outcome to occur.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any evidence that Sanaa intended for the negative outcome (junior staff members not learning to draft documents manually) to occur. 
2. Sanaa's decision to not prevent the introduction of the new software seems to be based on the overall benefit it brings to the law firm in terms of efficiency and streamlining processes.
3. The negative outcome would have occurred regardless of Sanaa's decision due to the trend towards technological efficiency in legal practices.
4. As a Utilitarian, Sanaa's decision is evaluated based on its effectiveness in maximizing the overall good or benefit, not on her intentions.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story presents a situation where a new hydraulic lift can help with the repairs of a small subset of vehicles but produces a low humming noise that is distracting to some workers.
2. Diego, the agent in this scenario, decides not to prevent his colleague's use of the new hydraulic lift.
3. As a utilitarian, Diego's decision would be based on maximizing the overall good or benefit. In this case, the benefit is the increased efficiency in repairing a subset of vehicles.
4. The negative outcome, the low humming noise, is not something Diego intended. It's a side effect of the new lift, and it would still occur even if Diego prevented his colleague from using the lift due to industry-wide advancements.
5. Therefore, Diego's intention was not for the negative outcome to occur, but rather to maximize the overall good by allowing the use of the more efficient lift.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story presents a situation where Amara's decision to allow her colleague's participation in VR combat training could lead to some soldiers experiencing short dizziness.
2. However, the story also mentions that this dizziness would occur regardless of Amara's decision, due to the evolution of military training protocols to include VR sessions.
3. Therefore, Amara's decision does not directly cause the negative outcome. It would have happened anyway.
4. The statement suggests that Amara intended for the negative outcome to occur. However, there is no evidence in the story to suggest that Amara intended for the soldiers to experience dizziness. Her decision was based on the benefit of the VR training, not the side effect.
5. As a utilitarian, I would consider the overall good or benefit. In this case, the benefit of the VR training outweighs the short-term dizziness, especially since the dizziness would occur regardless of the decision.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. Thanh's decision is based on the overall good or benefit. The new digital reporting system for minor incidents is slightly easier to use, which could potentially increase efficiency and effectiveness in the police department.
2. The negative outcome, which is the frustration among older officers, is not intended by Thanh. It is a side effect of the new system and would occur regardless of whether Thanh prevents the implementation or not due to a shift in police department policy.
3. Thanh's intention is not to cause frustration but to allow a potentially beneficial system to be implemented. The negative outcome is an unavoidable consequence, not an intended result.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
