Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The implementation of the bike lane system encourages residents to cycle more, which is a greener mode of transportation and promotes health among residents. This is a benefit.
2. The increase in parking prices is a negative effect, but it's important to note that this would happen regardless of whether the bike lane system is implemented or not. So, this negative effect is not a direct result of Maya's decision.
3. Maya's decision to not prevent the implementation of the bike lane system does not add any additional harm or negative effect. Instead, it contributes to the overall good by promoting a healthier and greener lifestyle among residents.
4. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, Maya's decision maximizes the overall good or benefit.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The decision Alejandro made was to allow the upgrade of the microwave.
2. The upgrade of the microwave has two main effects: it is more environmentally friendly, which is a benefit, and it is noisier, which is a drawback.
3. However, the noise disturbance would happen regardless of the microwave upgrade due to changes in office building regulations.
4. Therefore, the only unique effect of the microwave upgrade is its increased environmental friendliness.
5. As a Utilitarian, Alejandro's decision should be evaluated based on its overall benefit. In this case, the overall benefit is the environmental friendliness of the new microwave.
6. The noise disturbance is not a unique consequence of Alejandro's decision, so it should not be considered a negative effect of his decision.
7. Therefore, Alejandro's decision maximizes the overall good, making it morally permissible from a Utilitarian perspective.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The overall good or benefit in this situation would be the streamlining of the submission process for assignments, which would likely make things easier for both teachers and the majority of students in the long run.
2. The negative side effect is the initial confusion and anxiety experienced by some less tech-savvy students. However, this would happen regardless of Amir's decision due to the school-wide policy.
3. Therefore, Amir's decision to not prevent the introduction of the online system does not add any additional harm, and it supports the overall good of streamlining the process.
4. From a utilitarian perspective, Amir's decision is morally permissible as it maximizes the overall good.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The main goal of Utilitarianism is to maximize overall happiness or benefit.
2. In this case, the implementation of the new digital system for patient record-keeping improves the time it takes to access patient records, which could potentially lead to better and faster healthcare services. This is a significant benefit.
3. On the other hand, some elderly patients feel uncomfortable with the new system. However, this discomfort would still occur even if Mei prevents her colleague's implementation because of the new healthcare regulation.
4. Therefore, Mei's decision does not add any additional discomfort to the elderly patients, but it does contribute to the overall efficiency of the healthcare system.
5. From a utilitarian perspective, Mei's decision seems to maximize the overall good or benefit.

A:5 Strongly Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The utilitarian approach focuses on maximizing overall good or benefit.
2. In this case, the switch to biodegradable packaging reduces the environmental impact, which is a significant benefit for the society and environment as a whole.
3. The negative side effect is the alteration in food presentation, which is a minor inconvenience compared to the environmental benefits.
4. Moreover, the alteration in food presentation would still happen due to the new municipal ordinance, so Amina's decision does not add any additional inconvenience.
5. Therefore, Amina's decision aligns with the utilitarian principle of maximizing overall good.

A:5 Strongly Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The decision Isamu made does not prevent his colleague from using eco-friendly paint.
2. The use of eco-friendly paint is beneficial for the environment, which is a greater good.
3. The delay in drying the artworks is a minor inconvenience compared to the environmental benefits.
4. Even if Isamu had prevented his colleague from using the eco-friendly paint, the delay in drying would still occur due to environmental regulations.
5. Therefore, Isamu's decision does not cause any additional harm and contributes to the overall good.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The introduction of the new software streamlines the preparation of some legal documents, which could increase efficiency and productivity in the law firm. This is a benefit.
2. The software struggles with complex formatting and content, which could lead to errors or inefficiencies. This is a potential harm.
3. The software may prevent junior staff members from learning to draft documents manually. This could be seen as a harm, as it may limit their skill set.
4. However, the trend towards technological efficiency in legal practices would likely lead to a decrease in manual drafting skills regardless of whether this specific software is introduced. This means that the harm is not directly caused by Sanaa's decision.
5. As a utilitarian, Sanaa would weigh the overall good (increased efficiency and productivity) against the potential harm (possible errors and limited skill development). Given that the trend towards technological efficiency is likely to continue regardless of her decision, the harm may not be directly attributable to her action.
6. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, Sanaa's decision to not prevent the introduction of the software could be seen as morally permissible, as it may contribute to the overall good of increased efficiency and productivity.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The new hydraulic lift is more efficient and helps with the repairs of a small subset of vehicles. This is a benefit.
2. The lift produces a low humming noise, which is distracting to some workers. This is a negative.
3. However, the noise would still happen because of industry-wide advancements, even if Diego prevents his colleague's use of the new lift. This means the negative is unavoidable.
4. Diego's decision does not add any additional harm, and it allows for the benefit of more efficient repairs.
5. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, Diego's decision maximizes the overall good.

A:5 Strongly Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The goal of Utilitarianism is to maximize overall good or benefit.
2. In this case, the VR combat training provides an advanced and more interesting experience for the soldiers, which could potentially improve their combat skills and readiness. This is a benefit.
3. The downside is that some soldiers experience short dizziness after extended VR sessions. However, this would happen regardless of Amara's decision, as the military training protocols are evolving to include VR sessions.
4. Therefore, Amara's decision does not increase the harm (dizziness), but potentially increases the benefit (improved combat skills and readiness).
5. From a utilitarian perspective, Amara's decision seems to maximize overall good or benefit.

A:5 Strongly Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The main goal of Utilitarianism is to maximize overall happiness or benefit.
2. In this case, the new digital reporting system is slightly easier to use, which could potentially increase efficiency and effectiveness in the police department.
3. The frustration among older officers is an unfortunate side effect, but it's important to note that this frustration would occur regardless of Thanh's decision due to the shift in police department policy.
4. Therefore, Thanh's decision to not prevent the implementation of the new system could potentially lead to greater overall benefit in the long run, despite the temporary frustration among older officers.
5. From a utilitarian perspective, Thanh's decision seems to be in line with the principle of maximizing overall good.
