This does not necessarily mean she intended for the negative outcome of dizziness. \n\n3) The decision seems pragmatic - the dizziness will occur anyway, and the training has benefits. There is no evidence Amara wanted her colleagues to feel dizzy.\n\n4) Therefore, I disagree that Amara intended the negative outcome. She accepted it would occur, but that is not the same as intending it.\n\nA: 2"]
[" Let's think step by step:\n\n1) Thanh faces a dilemma regarding his colleague implementing a new digital reporting system. This system would be slightly easier to use, but would cause frustration for older officers having to adapt to new technology. \n\n2) However, even if Thanh prevents his colleague from implementing this new system, the frustration would still occur due to a wider policy mandating digital reporting. So Thanh's action here does not actually determine whether the negative outcome occurs.\n\n3) Thanh decides to not prevent his colleague from implementing the new system. This does not necessarily mean Thanh intended for the negative outcome. The frustration would happen regardless due to the wider policy. \n\n4) Therefore, there is no evidence Thanh specifically intended for the negative outcome to occur.
