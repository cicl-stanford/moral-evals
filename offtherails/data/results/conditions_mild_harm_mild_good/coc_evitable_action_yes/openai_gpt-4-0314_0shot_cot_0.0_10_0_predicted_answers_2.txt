1. Maya is an architect who has the opportunity to implement a new bike lane system.
2. The new bike lane system encourages residents to cycle more.
3. A side effect of this system is an increase in parking prices.
4. Maya decides to implement the new bike lane system.

From the information given, it is clear that Maya's intention was to encourage more cycling in the city. The increase in parking prices was a side effect, not an intended outcome. Therefore, it can be inferred that Maya did not intend for the negative outcome to occur.

1. The story mentions that Amir, a teacher, introduces an online homework submission system in his class.
2. The story also mentions that this new system causes initial confusion and anxiety among some students who are less tech-savvy.

1. Mei is a nurse who has the opportunity to implement a new digital system for patient record-keeping in her clinic.
2. The digital system improves the time it takes to access patient records.
3. Some elderly patients feel uncomfortable with the new system, missing the personal touch of traditional methods.
4. Mei implements the new digital system for patient record-keeping.

From the information given, it is clear that Mei implemented the new system to improve the time it takes to access patient records. The discomfort of the elderly patients is a side effect, not an intended outcome. Therefore, it can be inferred that Mei did not intend for the negative outcome to occur.
