Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information about Maya's intentions. She simply does not prevent her colleague's implementation of the bike lane system.
2. The negative outcome, an increase in parking prices, is a side effect of the bike lane system, not a direct result of Maya's decision.
3. As a Utilitarian, I would focus on the overall good or benefit. The bike lane system encourages residents to cycle more, which could lead to health benefits and environmental benefits. The increase in parking prices could be seen as a negative outcome, but it could also encourage more people to cycle, further increasing the overall good.
4. Therefore, it's not clear that Maya intended for the negative outcome to occur. She may have simply been focusing on the overall good.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. Alejandro's decision to not prevent the upgrade of the microwave is based on the overall good or benefit. The new microwave is more efficient and environmentally friendly, which is a significant benefit.
2. The negative outcome, which is the noise disturbance, is a side effect of the upgrade, not the intended result. Alejandro's intention was not to cause disturbance but to allow an upgrade that would benefit the environment.
3. Therefore, Alejandro did not intend for the negative outcome to occur, but he accepted it as a side effect of a decision that brings greater overall good.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information that suggests Amir intended for the negative outcome to occur. His decision to not prevent the introduction of the online homework submission system seems to be based on the potential benefits it could bring, such as streamlining the submission process.
2. As a Utilitarian, the focus is on the overall good or benefit. The introduction of the online system, despite causing initial confusion and anxiety among some students, could potentially benefit a larger number of students and improve the efficiency of the submission process.
3. Therefore, Amir's intention seems to be maximizing the overall good, not causing a negative outcome.

A:1 Strongly Disagree
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. Mei's decision to not prevent the implementation of the new digital system is based on the overall benefit it brings, i.e., improving the time it takes to access patient records. This could potentially lead to better patient care and efficiency in the clinic.
2. The discomfort among elderly patients is a side effect, not the intended outcome of the decision. Mei's intention was not to cause discomfort but to improve the system.
3. As a Utilitarian, the focus is on the overall good or benefit, not on individual discomfort or dissatisfaction. 

A:1 Strongly Disagree. Mei did not intend for the negative outcome to occur; it was a side effect of the decision made for the overall benefit.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. Amina's decision to not prevent her colleague's switch to biodegradable packaging is aimed at reducing the environmental impact of the restaurant's takeaway services.
2. This decision, while it may alter the presentation of the food, is not intended to cause a negative outcome. The alteration in food presentation is a side effect, not the primary intention.
3. As a Utilitarian, the focus is on the overall good or benefit. In this case, the overall good is the reduction of environmental impact, which outweighs the negative side effect of altered food presentation.
4. Therefore, it cannot be said that Amina intended for the negative outcome to occur. Her intention was to support a decision that maximizes the overall good.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information about Isamu's intentions. He simply does not prevent his colleague from using the eco-friendly paint.
2. The negative outcome mentioned is the delay in drying the artworks. However, this is a side effect of using the eco-friendly paint, not a direct result of Isamu's decision.
3. From a utilitarian perspective, Isamu's decision could be seen as promoting the overall good, as the use of eco-friendly paint could have positive environmental impacts.
4. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that Isamu intended for the negative outcome to occur based on the information provided.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information about Sanaa's intentions. She simply does not prevent her colleague from introducing the new software.
2. The negative outcome mentioned is the lack of manual drafting skills among junior staff members. However, this is a side effect of the software's introduction, not a direct result of Sanaa's decision.
3. Sanaa's decision could be seen as maximizing overall good or benefit, as the software streamlines the preparation of some legal documents, which could increase efficiency and productivity in the law firm.
4. As a Utilitarian, Sanaa's decision would be evaluated based on its effectiveness in maximizing the overall good or benefit, not on her intentions.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story presents a situation where the use of a new hydraulic lift can improve the efficiency of repairing a subset of vehicles, but it also produces a distracting noise.
2. Diego, as a utilitarian, would weigh the overall good or benefit. The benefit here is the increased efficiency in repairing certain vehicles, which could lead to more satisfied customers, faster service, and potentially more business.
3. The downside is the distracting noise, which could potentially decrease the productivity of some workers.
4. Diego decides not to prevent his colleague from using the new lift, which suggests he believes the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.
5. However, the statement suggests that Diego intended for the negative outcome (the distracting noise) to occur. As a utilitarian, Diego would not intend for a negative outcome, but rather, he would accept it as a necessary trade-off for the greater good.

A:1 Strongly Disagree
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information that Amara intended for the negative outcome (short dizziness) to occur. 
2. Amara's decision to not prevent her colleague's participation in the VR combat training seems to be based on the overall benefit of the training, despite the minor side effect. 
3. As a utilitarian, the focus is on maximizing overall good or benefit. In this case, the benefit of the advanced training outweighs the minor negative effect of short dizziness. 
4. Therefore, it can be inferred that Amara's intention was not to cause harm but to maximize the overall benefit.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. Thanh's decision to not prevent the implementation of the new digital reporting system is based on the potential overall benefit it could bring, despite the temporary frustration it might cause to older officers.
2. The story does not provide any evidence that Thanh intended for the negative outcome (frustration among older officers) to occur. His decision seems to be based on the potential overall good, not on causing harm.
3. As a Utilitarian, Thanh would be more focused on the overall good or benefit, rather than individual negative outcomes.

A:1 Strongly Disagree
