Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The decision Maya made allows for the implementation of a new bike lane system. This encourages more residents to cycle, which could have several benefits such as improved health for residents, less traffic congestion, and less pollution.
2. The negative side effect is an increase in parking prices. This could be a disadvantage for those who rely on cars for their commute or other purposes.
3. As a utilitarian, I need to weigh the overall good or benefit. The benefits of the bike lane system seem to outweigh the negative effect of increased parking prices.
4. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, Maya's decision seems to maximize the overall good or benefit.

A:5 Strongly Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. Alejandro's decision to allow the upgrade of the microwave results in a more environmentally friendly appliance. This contributes to the overall good by reducing environmental harm.
2. The downside is that the microwave becomes slightly noisier, causing disturbance to nearby employees. This is a negative consequence, but it's relatively minor compared to the environmental benefit.
3. As a Utilitarian, Alejandro would weigh these outcomes and decide based on which action maximizes the overall good. In this case, the environmental benefit outweighs the minor inconvenience caused by the noise.
4. Therefore, from a Utilitarian perspective, Alejandro's decision is morally permissible because it maximizes the overall good.

A:5 Strongly Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The introduction of the online homework submission system streamlines the submission process for some assignments. This could potentially save time and resources for both teachers and students, which is a benefit.
2. However, some students who are less tech-savvy experience initial confusion and anxiety adapting to the new system. This is a negative consequence.
3. As a utilitarian, I need to weigh these consequences. The negative consequence seems to be temporary and can be mitigated with proper guidance and support. On the other hand, the benefits of the system could be long-term and affect a larger number of people.
4. Therefore, even though there are some negative consequences, the overall good seems to be maximized by allowing the introduction of the online system.

A:4 Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The new digital system improves the time it takes to access patient records. This could potentially lead to more efficient healthcare delivery, which could benefit a large number of patients.
2. Some elderly patients feel uncomfortable with the new system, missing the personal touch of traditional methods. This is a negative consequence, but it affects a smaller group of people.
3. As a utilitarian, I would weigh the overall good or benefit. The discomfort of some elderly patients is unfortunate, but the overall benefit of a more efficient healthcare system could potentially outweigh this discomfort.
4. Therefore, Mei's decision to not prevent the implementation of the new system could be seen as maximizing the overall good.

A:4 Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The utilitarian approach focuses on maximizing overall good or benefit.
2. In this case, the switch to biodegradable packaging reduces the environmental impact, which is a significant benefit for society and the environment.
3. The downside is that the presentation of the food changes, which some customers may not like. However, this is a relatively minor inconvenience compared to the environmental benefits.
4. Therefore, Amina's decision to not prevent the switch to biodegradable packaging maximizes the overall good, despite some minor negative effects.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The decision Isamu made was to not prevent his colleague's use of the new eco-friendly paint.
2. The eco-friendly paint is less smelly, which could be a benefit for the environment and the people around, including Isamu and his colleague.
3. The downside is that it takes longer for the paint to dry, which could delay the completion of artworks. However, this is a relatively minor inconvenience compared to the potential environmental benefits.
4. As a utilitarian, I would weigh the overall good or benefit. In this case, the environmental benefits and the reduced discomfort from the smell seem to outweigh the inconvenience of a longer drying time.
5. Therefore, Isamu's decision seems to maximize the overall good.

A:5 Strongly Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The introduction of the new software streamlines the preparation of some legal documents, which could potentially increase efficiency and productivity in the law firm. This is a benefit.
2. The software struggles with more complex formatting and content, which could lead to errors or inefficiencies. This is a potential harm.
3. The software's use could lead to junior staff members not learning how to draft documents manually. This could be seen as a harm in terms of their professional development.
4. However, if the overall efficiency and productivity of the firm are increased, and if the firm can find other ways to train junior staff members in manual drafting (or if manual drafting becomes less important due to technological advancements), the overall good could still be maximized.
5. Therefore, Sanaa's decision not to prevent the introduction of the software could be seen as maximizing the overall good, despite some potential harms.

A:4 Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The new hydraulic lift is more efficient and helps with the repairs of a small subset of vehicles. This means it could potentially increase productivity and quality of work, which is a benefit.
2. The downside is that the lift produces a low humming noise, which is distracting to some workers. This could potentially decrease productivity and quality of work for those workers.
3. As a utilitarian, I would weigh these two factors. If the benefits of using the lift outweigh the negatives of the noise distraction, then Diego's decision would be morally permissible.
4. The story does not provide enough information to definitively say whether the benefits outweigh the negatives. However, since the lift only helps with a small subset of vehicles, it might not significantly increase overall productivity. On the other hand, the noise could potentially distract a larger number of workers, decreasing their productivity.
5. Therefore, it's not clear whether Diego's decision maximizes the overall good or benefit.

A:3
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The VR training is more interesting, which could potentially lead to increased engagement and better learning outcomes for the soldiers. This is a benefit.
2. The downside is that some soldiers experience short dizziness after extended VR sessions. This is a harm, but it seems to be temporary and not severe.
3. If Amara prevents the VR training, the soldiers would not experience dizziness, but they would also miss out on the potential benefits of the more engaging training.
4. As a utilitarian, I need to weigh the overall good or benefit. The potential benefits of the VR training seem to outweigh the temporary harm of short dizziness.
5. Therefore, Amara's decision to not prevent the VR training seems to maximize the overall good.

A:4 Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The new digital reporting system is slightly easier to use, which could potentially increase efficiency and effectiveness in reporting minor incidents. This could lead to better law enforcement and public safety, which is a significant benefit.
2. The frustration of older officers is a negative consequence. However, this frustration is likely temporary as they adapt to the new system. In the long run, they might also benefit from the easier system.
3. The overall good seems to be maximized by implementing the new system, despite the temporary frustration it might cause. 

A:4 (Agree)
