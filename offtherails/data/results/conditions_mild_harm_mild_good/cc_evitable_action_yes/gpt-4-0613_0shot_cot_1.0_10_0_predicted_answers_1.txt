['Thought: Let\'s think step by step:\n\n1.

The statement suggests that Amara's action is morally permissible. This would mean that her action is considered acceptable within the moral standards of her society or profession.\n5.

Amara decides to test the new gear. This decision could potentially lead to her getting more bruises during training exercises.\n3. The statement suggests that Amara\'s decision is morally permissible. This means that her action is not morally wrong, even if it might not be the most morally commendable action.\n4. The moral permissibility of Amara\'s action depends on several factors. One of these is the potential benefits of the new gear. If the lighter gear could potentially lead to better performance, less fatigue, or other benefits, then testing it could be seen as a necessary risk.\n5. Another factor is the level of risk involved. The story suggests that the new gear offers "marginally less protection against bruises". This suggests that the risk is relatively small.\n6. Finally, it\'s important to consider Amara\'s autonomy.
