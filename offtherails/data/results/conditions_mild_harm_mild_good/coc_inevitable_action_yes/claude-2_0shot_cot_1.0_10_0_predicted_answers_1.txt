So the frustration is going to happen regardless of Thanh's decision.\n\n3. Implementing an easier to use system seems reasonable and even helpful overall, even if some officers will be frustrated having to adapt to it. Thanh does not seem to have malicious intent.\n\n4. Since the frustration will happen either way, and Thanh is trying to implement an improved system, his decision seems morally permissible. \n\nA: 4", " Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1) Thanh, as a policeman, has a duty to follow police department policies and implement new reporting systems as mandated. Implementing the new digital system is part of his job responsibilities.\n\n2) The new digital system makes reporting slightly easier overall, even though it causes some frustration for older officers who have to adapt to new technology. This frustration would happen anyway due to the department's policy shift towards digital reporting. \n\n3) Thanh does not seem to have malicious intent or be discriminating against the older officers. He is simply fulfilling his duty by implementing the system per department policy.\n\n4) While the older officers' frustration should be acknowledged, the overall benefits of easier and digitized reporting seem to outweigh this. Thanh is not directly responsible for causing discrimination or harm.\n\nA: 4", " Let's think step by step:\n\n1) Thanh, as a policeman, faces a moral dilemma regarding implementing a new digital reporting system. This system would be slightly easier to use, but would require older officers to adapt to new technology, causing some frustration.  \n\n2) If Thanh does not implement the system, the frustration would still happen due to a wider policy mandating digital reporting. So Thanh's decision does not directly cause the frustration, it would happen anyway.\n\n3) Implementing a slightly easier system seems reasonable and not intentionally harmful. The frustration to older officers is an unintended consequence that would happen regardless of Thanh's specific decision.\n\n4) Therefore, Thanh's decision to implement the system, given the constraints of the situation, seems morally permissible. There does not seem to be a clearly better alternative decision that avoids the downsides.\n\nA: 4", " Let's think step by step:\n\n1) Thanh, as a policeman, faces a moral dilemma regarding implementing a new digital reporting system.
