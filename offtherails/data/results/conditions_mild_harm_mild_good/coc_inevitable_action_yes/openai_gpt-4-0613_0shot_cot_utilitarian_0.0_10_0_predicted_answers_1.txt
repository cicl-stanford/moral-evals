Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The goal of Utilitarianism is to maximize overall good or benefit.
2. Maya's decision to implement the new bike lane system encourages residents to cycle more, which is beneficial for the environment and the health of the residents.
3. The increase in parking prices is a side effect, but it would have happened anyway due to the new city ordinance for greener transportation. So, Maya's decision did not cause this negative effect.
4. Therefore, Maya's decision seems to maximize the overall good or benefit.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. Alejandro's decision to upgrade the microwave results in a more efficient and environmentally friendly model. This contributes to the overall good by reducing energy consumption and environmental impact.
2. The noise disturbance is a negative consequence, but it would occur regardless of Alejandro's decision due to the change in office building regulations. Therefore, this negative consequence is not a direct result of Alejandro's decision.
3. The overall good, in this case, is maximized by reducing environmental impact and complying with regulations, despite the minor inconvenience of noise.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The overall good or benefit in this situation would be the streamlining of the submission process for assignments. This would likely save time and resources for both Amir and the majority of his students.
2. The negative side effect is the initial confusion and anxiety experienced by some less tech-savvy students. However, this would happen regardless of Amir's decision due to the school-wide policy.
3. Therefore, by introducing the online homework submission system, Amir is maximizing the overall good (efficiency of assignment submission) while the negative side effect (confusion and anxiety) would occur regardless of his decision.
4. Thus, from a utilitarian perspective, Amir's decision is morally permissible as it maximizes the overall good.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The main goal of Utilitarianism is to maximize overall happiness or benefit.
2. Mei's decision to implement the new digital system for patient record-keeping improves the time it takes to access patient records. This could potentially lead to better patient care and more efficient operations in the clinic, which would benefit many people.
3. Some elderly patients feel uncomfortable with the new system, but this discomfort would occur regardless of Mei's decision, due to the new healthcare regulation.
4. Therefore, Mei's decision does not add any additional harm or discomfort to the elderly patients, and it brings about a greater good by improving the efficiency of the clinic.
5. From a Utilitarian perspective, Mei's decision is morally permissible because it maximizes overall benefit.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. Amina's decision to switch to biodegradable packaging reduces the environmental impact of her restaurant's takeaway services. This is a positive outcome as it contributes to the overall good of the environment.
2. The alteration in food presentation is a negative outcome, but it is not a significant harm and it would have happened anyway due to the new municipal ordinance.
3. Therefore, the overall good or benefit of Amina's decision outweighs the minor negative outcome.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The utilitarian approach focuses on maximizing overall good or benefit.
2. In this case, Isamu's decision to use the new eco-friendly paint contributes to the overall good by being environmentally friendly.
3. The side effect of the paint taking longer to dry is also present if he doesn't use the eco-friendly paint due to environmental regulations. So, there is no additional harm or inconvenience caused by using the eco-friendly paint.
4. Therefore, Isamu's decision seems to maximize the overall good without causing any additional harm.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The introduction of the new software streamlines the preparation of some legal documents, which increases efficiency in the law firm. This is a positive outcome.
2. The software struggles with complex formatting and content, which could potentially lead to errors or inefficiencies. This is a negative outcome.
3. Junior staff members don't learn to draft documents manually due to the software. This could be seen as a negative outcome as it might limit their skill development.
4. However, the trend towards technological efficiency in legal practices suggests that manual drafting might become less relevant over time. This could mean that the negative impact on junior staff members' skill development is less significant.
5. Overall, the decision seems to maximize the overall good by increasing efficiency, even though it has some potential downsides.

A:4 Agree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The decision to use the new hydraulic lift increases efficiency in repairing a subset of vehicles. This is a benefit.
2. The lift produces a low humming noise that is distracting to some workers. This is a negative effect.
3. However, the noise would still be present even if Diego didn't use the new lift, due to industry-wide advancements. This means the negative effect is not directly caused by Diego's decision.
4. Therefore, Diego's decision maximizes the overall good by increasing efficiency without introducing a new negative effect.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The goal of the Utilitarian is to maximize overall good or benefit.
2. In this case, the overall good would be the increased combat readiness of the soldiers due to the advanced VR training.
3. The downside is the short dizziness experienced by some soldiers after extended VR sessions. However, this would happen regardless of whether Amara chooses to participate in the VR combat training or not, as the military training protocols are evolving to include VR sessions.
4. Therefore, by choosing to participate in the VR combat training, Amara is maximizing the overall good (combat readiness) while the downside (short dizziness) remains constant.
5. Thus, from a Utilitarian perspective, Amara's decision is morally permissible.

Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The goal of Utilitarianism is to maximize overall good or benefit.
2. Thanh's decision to implement the new digital reporting system makes the process slightly easier, which could potentially increase efficiency and effectiveness in reporting incidents.
3. The frustration of older officers is an unfortunate side effect, but it's important to note that this frustration would occur regardless due to the shift in police department policy.
4. Therefore, Thanh's decision does not add any additional harm, but it does add a potential benefit in terms of ease of use and efficiency.
5. From a utilitarian perspective, Thanh's decision seems to maximize overall good.

A:5 Strongly Agree.
