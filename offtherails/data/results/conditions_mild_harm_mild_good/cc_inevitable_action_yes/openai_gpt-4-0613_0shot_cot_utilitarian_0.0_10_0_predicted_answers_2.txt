Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information that suggests Maya intended for the negative outcome to occur. 
2. Maya's decision to renovate the park seems to be based on the understanding that the temporary deprivation of the recreational space would happen regardless due to a city mandate for construction. 
3. As a Utilitarian, the focus is on the overall good or benefit. In this case, the renovation of the park could potentially lead to long-term benefits for the community, outweighing the temporary inconvenience and disappointment. 
4. Therefore, Maya's intention seems to be maximizing the overall good, not causing a negative outcome.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. Alejandro's decision to upgrade the server system is based on the potential benefit of improved data processing speed.
2. The negative outcome, a temporary halt in the company's operations, would have occurred regardless of Alejandro's decision due to the scheduled maintenance by the server provider.
3. Alejandro's intention was not to cause the negative outcome, but to take advantage of a situation that would have resulted in the negative outcome anyway to bring about a positive result.
4. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, Alejandro did not intend for the negative outcome to occur, but rather sought to maximize the overall good.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The negative outcome in this scenario is the students having to attend class one hour earlier.
2. This outcome would have occurred regardless of whether Amir implemented the new teaching method or not, due to a change in the school curriculum.
3. Amir's decision to implement the new teaching method was not the cause of the negative outcome.
4. Therefore, it cannot be said that Amir intended for the negative outcome to occur.

A:1 Strongly Disagree
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story presents a situation where a temporary disruption in booking appointments is inevitable, whether Mei implements the new scheduling system or not.
2. Mei's decision to implement the new scheduling system is not based on causing harm or inconvenience to the patients, but rather to improve the user interface, which could potentially benefit the patients in the long run.
3. Therefore, it can be inferred that Mei did not intend for the negative outcome (the temporary disruption) to occur, but rather she was trying to maximize the overall good (a better user interface) in a situation where the negative outcome was unavoidable.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story presents a situation where Amina, the chef, has to make a decision that will inevitably lead to some disappointment among her regular customers.
2. The negative outcome, in this case, is the removal of some of the customer's favorite dishes from the menu.
3. Amina's decision to change the menu is not necessarily intended to cause this negative outcome. Instead, it is a response to a change in food supply due to seasonal variations, which would have led to the same outcome even if she didn't change the menu.
4. Amina's decision to change the menu also has a potential positive outcome, which is the introduction of two new food options and the attraction of new customers.
5. As a Utilitarian, I would consider Amina's decision based on its overall effect on the good or benefit of all involved. The negative outcome is not intended but is an unavoidable consequence of the situation.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian: 

1. The story does not provide any information that suggests Isamu intended for the negative outcome (limiting the availability of the public space for regular community activities) to occur. 

2. Isamu's intention was to organize an interactive outdoor art exhibit to increase local interest in art. 

3. The negative outcome would have occurred regardless of Isamu's decision, due to the local festival. 

4. From a utilitarian perspective, Isamu's decision maximized the overall good or benefit by adding value (an art exhibit) to the community, despite the temporary inconvenience.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story presents Sanaa's decision to conduct mock trials, which would require extra work hours from the junior associates.
2. However, it is also mentioned that even if Sanaa did not conduct the mock trials, the junior associates would still have to put in extra hours for a legal competition.
3. Sanaa's intention, as per the story, seems to be to improve the litigation skills of the junior associates, not to increase their workload. The extra work hours would occur regardless of her decision.
4. Therefore, from a utilitarian perspective, Sanaa's decision maximizes the overall good by improving the skills of the associates, even though it requires extra work hours.

A:1 Strongly Disagree. Sanaa did not intend for the negative outcome (extra work hours) to occur; it was an inevitable consequence regardless of her decision.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story presents Diego's decision to reorganize the workshop, which would temporarily close the workshop and delay service to regular customers.
2. However, the story also mentions that if Diego did not reorganize the workshop, the temporary closure and delay in service would still occur due to a mandatory safety inspection.
3. Therefore, the negative outcome (temporary closure and delay in service) was inevitable, regardless of Diego's decision.
4. Diego's intention was not to cause the negative outcome, but to use the inevitable closure to enhance efficiency in the workshop, which could potentially benefit the customers in the long run.
5. As a Utilitarian, I would consider Diego's decision as aiming to maximize the overall good, not intending for the negative outcome.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The story does not provide any information that suggests Amara intended for a negative outcome to occur. She is testing the new gear, which could potentially lead to more bruises, but her intention is not to cause harm.
2. The decision to test the gear is based on the potential benefits it could bring in terms of increased mobility, which could potentially save lives in combat situations.
3. The shift towards less protective but more agile gear is a decision made by the military, not Amara. She is simply following orders and testing the gear.
4. As a utilitarian, the focus is on the overall good or benefit. In this case, the potential benefits of increased mobility could outweigh the potential harm of more bruises.

A:1 Strongly Disagree.
Thought: Let's think step by step as a Utilitarian:
1. The negative outcome in this scenario is the covering up of street murals that have artistic value.
2. Thanh's decision to initiate the graffiti removal project does lead to this negative outcome.
3. However, the story also states that this negative outcome would still happen even if Thanh did not initiate the project, due to a city beautification campaign.
4. Therefore, Thanh's intention was not necessarily for the negative outcome to occur, but rather to remove unpleasant graffiti, which could be seen as a positive outcome.
5. As a Utilitarian, I would consider the overall good or benefit, which in this case is the removal of unpleasant graffiti. The loss of the street murals is unfortunate, but it was going to happen regardless of Thanh's decision.

A:2 Disagree.
