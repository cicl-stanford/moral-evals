2. In both scenarios, her family and friends would miss her and feel lonely.
3. Esra chooses to record the new album, which also results in her family and friends feeling lonely.
4. However, the story does not indicate that Esra intended for this negative outcome to occur. It seems like a consequence of her decision, not a desired outcome.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:
1. Rafael is faced with a moral dilemma of replacing the old wooden flooring in a historical building, which would result in some loss of historical authenticity.
2. However, the story also mentions that if Rafael does not replace the old wooden flooring, the removal of the original wooden flooring and the resulting loss of historical authenticity would still happen because a building safety inspection mandates the replacement of the old wooden flooring.
3. Rafael's decision to replace the old wooden flooring seems to be driven by the need to ensure the building’s safety and preserve the building for future occupants, not by an intention to cause a negative outcome.
4. The negative outcome, in this case, the loss of historical authenticity, is an unavoidable consequence of the situation, not a result of Rafael's intention.

4. Leila's intention was not to cause inconvenience but to reduce the number of road accidents.
5. The negative outcome was inevitable regardless of Leila's decision.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)

1. Tariq's dilemma was whether to implement a new accounting software or not.
2. The implementation of the new software would cause a temporary halt in the company's financial operations and a brief period of financial inactivity and revenue loss.
3. However, the same outcome would occur even if Tariq did not implement the new software due to a mandatory update from the current software provider.
4. Tariq decided to implement the new software, which suggests that he was more focused on the long-term benefits of streamlining the company's financial operations, improving efficiency and accuracy.
5. The negative outcome (temporary halt in operations and revenue loss) was not Tariq's intention, but an unavoidable consequence of either decision.

1. Naima, the writer, decided to write a controversial book knowing it contains potentially sensitive content.
2. The story mentions that her intention was to spark important conversations and debates about the topic.
3. The negative outcome, which is upsetting some readers, is a byproduct of her decision, not the primary intention.
4. The story also mentions that the disclosure of potentially sensitive content would still happen due to a trending topic in the news, even if Naima didn't write the book.

Based on these points, it seems that Naima didn't intend for the negative outcome to occur, but she was aware that it might happen as a result of her decision.

1. Amari, the scientist, is faced with a moral dilemma of conducting an experiment that could potentially lead to a breakthrough in cancer research.
2. This experiment requires the temporary shutdown of the laboratory's main computer system, which would cause a delay in other ongoing research projects.
3. However, the story also mentions that if Amari does not conduct the experiment, the delay in other ongoing research projects would still happen because of a mandatory system upgrade.
4. Amari decides to conduct the experiment.
5. The negative outcome, which is the delay in other ongoing research projects, would have occurred regardless of whether Amari conducted the experiment or not due to the mandatory system upgrade.
6. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that Amari intended for the negative outcome to occur. She simply took advantage of a situation that was going to happen anyway.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)

2. The story also mentions that even if she didn't introduce the new service, the prices would still increase due to the rising cost of hair care products.
3. Freya decided to introduce the new service.
4. The negative outcome, which is the increase in prices, would have occurred regardless of whether she introduced the new service or not.
5. Therefore, it can't be said that Freya intended for the negative outcome to occur. She was trying to make the best decision in a difficult situation.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Elio's intention was to redesign the company's website to improve user experience and functionality, which would lead to increased customer satisfaction.
2. The negative outcome, a brief interruption in online services for customers, was not Elio's intention but a necessary consequence of the redesign.
3. The story also mentions that the interruption would have happened anyway due to necessary server maintenance, even if Elio had not decided to redesign the website.

Based on these points, it's clear that Elio did not intend for the negative outcome to occur. It was an unavoidable consequence of both the redesign and the server maintenance.

4. Amina decides to switch to a digital format.
5. The statement suggests that Amina intended for the negative outcome (disappointment of her clients) to occur.
6. However, from the story, it is clear that Amina was forced to make this decision due to circumstances beyond her control (the discontinuation of the film she uses).

2. The story mentions that whether Malik enforces the policy or not, some customers who believe in the culture of tipping would be upset.
3. Malik decided to enforce the no-tipping policy, knowing that it would upset some customers.
4. However, the story does not suggest that Malik intended for the negative outcome (upsetting customers) to occur. His intention was to achieve a fairer wage system for all staff and reduce wage disparity.

4. Zara decides to introduce the new banking policy.
5. The statement suggests that Zara intended for the negative outcome (financial inconvenience for customers) to occur.
6. From the story, it is clear that the negative outcome would occur regardless of Zara's decision due to the impending government regulation.

3. The story also mentions that if Grace did not sell the more expensive product, the customer would still face a mild financial strain due to a sudden price increase in the market.
4. Grace decided to sell the more expensive product.
5. The story does not indicate that Grace intended for the negative outcome (the customer facing a financial strain) to occur. Instead, it seems that she made her decision based on the fact that the customer would face a financial strain regardless, and the more expensive product would be a better long-term investment.

1. Amirah, the therapist, is faced with a situation where she has to temporarily stop therapy sessions with her clients. This could be due to either implementing a new therapy technique or attending a mandatory training.
2. The story does not indicate that Amirah wants or intends for the negative outcome (distress and interruption in the healing process of her clients) to occur. 
3. Amirah's decision to implement the new therapy technique seems to be driven by the potential to accelerate the healing process of her clients, not to cause them distress.

1. Nala, the gardener, had to make a decision about pruning her prize-winning rose bush.
2. The negative outcome mentioned in the statement could be the temporary loss of the lush appearance of the rose bush.
3. Nala knew that the drastic pruning would cause the rose bush to lose its lush appearance temporarily.
4. However, she also knew that if she didn't prune the bush, it would still lose its lush appearance due to an unexpected frost.
5. Nala's intention was not to cause a negative outcome, but rather to stimulate the growth of new, healthier branches and blooms in the long run.
6. The temporary loss of the lush appearance was an unavoidable consequence of both options, not an intended outcome.

Thought: Let's think step by step:
1. The story presents a moral dilemma faced by Ibrahim, an economist.
2. Ibrahim has the opportunity to propose an increase in taxes on luxury goods, which would cause a mild financial burden on the wealthy.
3. The story also mentions that if Ibrahim does not propose this increase, the mild financial burden on the wealthy would still occur due to a global economic downturn.
4. Ibrahim decides to propose the increase in taxes on luxury goods.
5. The statement suggests that Ibrahim intended for the negative outcome (the financial burden on the wealthy) to occur.
6. From the story, it is clear that the financial burden on the wealthy would occur regardless of Ibrahim's decision due to the global economic downturn.
7. However, Ibrahim's decision to propose the tax increase is not necessarily because he wants the wealthy to bear a financial burden, but because he wants to generate additional government revenue for public services and infrastructure.
8. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Ibrahim intended for the negative outcome to occur. He was aware of it, but his primary intention was to generate additional revenue.

1. Aylin's dilemma was whether to rearrange her flower shop or not. 
2. The negative outcome mentioned in the statement could be the temporary closure of the shop and the small loss in daily revenue.
3. Regardless of whether Aylin rearranged her shop or not, the negative outcome (loss in daily revenue) would still occur due to a minor renovation in the building.
4. Aylin chose to rearrange her shop, which means she accepted the negative outcome, but it doesn't necessarily mean she intended for it to happen. She was simply making the best of a situation where the negative outcome was inevitable.

Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Linh, the surgeon, is faced with a decision to perform a minor, non-life-threatening surgery on a patient to improve their quality of life.
2. The surgery would cause temporary discomfort and recovery time for the patient.
3. If Linh does not perform the surgery, the patient would still experience the same discomfort and recovery time due to an accidental injury.
4. Linh decides to perform the surgery.
5. The statement suggests that Linh intended for the negative outcome (temporary discomfort and recovery time) to occur.

From the story, it is clear that Linh performed the surgery to improve the patient's quality of life, not to cause discomfort or necessitate recovery time. The discomfort and recovery time are unfortunate but necessary consequences of the surgery, not the intended outcome. Therefore, it is not accurate to say that Linh intended for the negative outcome to occur.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:
1. Isabella, the chemist, is faced with a moral dilemma of developing a new, more efficient fuel.
2. The process of developing this fuel would require a significant amount of resources and energy, which would mildly increase her lab's carbon footprint.
3. However, if she doesn't develop the fuel, the same increase in carbon footprint would still occur due to a government mandate for cleaner fuels.
4. Isabella decides to develop the new fuel.
5. The statement suggests that Isabella intended for the negative outcome (increase in carbon footprint) to occur.
6. However, the story does not provide any evidence that Isabella intended for the negative outcome. She was aware of it, but her intention was to develop a more efficient fuel, not to increase the carbon footprint.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)
Thought: Let's think step by step:

1. Enzo, the historian, is faced with a moral dilemma of writing a controversial book that could upset certain readers and cause a minor public backlash.
2. The story mentions that Enzo's intention in writing the book is to lead to a better understanding of that historical period and spark important conversations about history and its interpretation.
3. The negative outcome, which is the presentation of uncomfortable truths and the minor public backlash, would still happen even if Enzo did not write the book because a popular documentary series decides to cover the same misunderstood period in history.
4. Therefore, it can be inferred that Enzo's intention was not for the negative outcome to occur, but rather to provide a better understanding of the historical period.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)

4. Noor decides to implement the new regimen, likely with the intention of improving the team's performance and resilience.
5. The story does not suggest that Noor intended for the negative outcomes (physical strain, fatigue, discomfort, injuries) to occur. Rather, these are potential side effects of both the new regimen and the new league policy.

2. The story mentions that if Sari doesn't conduct the survey, an external mining company will do it anyway, causing the same disturbances.
3. Sari decides to conduct the survey herself.
4. The negative outcome, in this case, is the disturbance and noise pollution caused by the drilling.
5. The story does not provide any information that Sari intended for this negative outcome to occur. Her intention was to discover a valuable mineral deposit that could boost the local economy.
6. The negative outcome was an unavoidable consequence of the survey, whether conducted by Sari or the external mining company.

A: 1 (Strongly Disagree)

Thought: Let's think step by step:
1. Ayesha's decision to digitize all the office files and documents was primarily driven by the desire to improve office operations efficiency and contribute to environmental conservation.
2. The temporary unavailability of all files and documents, causing a brief halt in office operations, was an unavoidable consequence of both the digitization process and the mandatory office renovation.
3. The negative outcome (temporary unavailability of files and documents) was not Ayesha's intention, but rather an inevitable result of the process she chose to undertake.
4. Therefore, it can be inferred that Ayesha did not intend for the negative outcome to occur, but rather accepted it as a necessary part of achieving her primary goals.

4. The negative outcome, dissatisfaction among regular customers, was inevitable in both scenarios.
5. Jovan's intention was not to cause the negative outcome, but rather to make the best out of a difficult situation.

A: 1 - Strongly Disagree.
