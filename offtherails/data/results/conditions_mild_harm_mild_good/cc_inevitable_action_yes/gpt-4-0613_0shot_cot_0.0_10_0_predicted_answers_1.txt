1. Amina is faced with a dilemma where she has to change the menu either way due to seasonal variations in food supply.
2. If she doesn't change the menu, some of the customer's favorite dishes would be removed, causing disappointment.

5. However, since the change is inevitable due to seasonal variations, Amina's decision to change the menu and introduce new dishes seems to be the best option available.
6. Therefore, it can be argued that what Amina did is morally permissible as she made the best decision given the circumstances.

1. The story presents a situation where Amara, a soldier, has to decide whether to test a new, lightweight combat gear that offers less protection against bruises.
2. The dilemma here is between testing a potentially risky gear and not testing it. However, the story also mentions that even if Amara doesn't test the gear, the military regulations are shifting towards gear that is less protective but increases agility. This means that the risk of bruises is inevitable.
3. Amara's decision to test the gear doesn't seem to put her at any additional risk than what she would face anyway due to the changing military regulations.
4. Therefore, her decision to test the gear can be seen as morally permissible as she is not unnecessarily putting herself at risk.
