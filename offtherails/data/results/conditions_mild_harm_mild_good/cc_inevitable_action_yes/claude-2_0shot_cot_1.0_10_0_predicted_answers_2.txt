But based on the story, Thanh did not specifically intend this - he just knew it would happen as a consequence.\n\nA: 2", " Thought: Let's think step by step:\n\n1) Thanh faces a moral dilemma regarding initiating a graffiti removal project. The project would remove unpleasant graffiti but also cover up street murals with artistic value. \n\n2) If Thanh does not initiate the project, the street murals would still be covered up due to a city beautification campaign. So the negative outcome would occur regardless of Thanh's decision.\n\n3) By initiating the project, Thanh did not specifically intend for the artistic murals to be covered up, even though that was an inevitable result. His intention was to remove the unpleasant graffiti.\n\n4) Therefore, I disagree that Thanh intended the negative outcome to occur. The covering of murals would happen anyway due to the city campaign. His decision just allowed the graffiti removal to happen concurrently.\n\nA: 2"]
